          <h3>Electrical Systems Engineering</h3>
          <p>During my time at Bentley, I have developed the rear touch screen interface on all 4 door vehicles. This was an extensive project that involved many technologies. This is a Bentley unique design that allows the rear occupants to have as much control as the front passengers.
