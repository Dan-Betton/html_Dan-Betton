        <h3>Next Generation Flying Spur</h3>
        <p>My first project for Bentley was to develop a Touch Screen Remote (TSR), for the new Flying Spur. The TSR's main purpose is to give the customer control, this includes features such as; climate, seat massage, seat heat and vent, blinds, radio, media, sound, interior illumination etc. The predecessor TSR was now redundant, new hardware and software had to be developed. The TSR is one part of a 3-part system, which includes its master ECU, and the Cradle that it is stored in. The system utilises CAN, Bluetooth, WiFi to control features. HMI was designed for all features for the best customer experience, this involved cross functional working with relevant feature owners, quality, and the UI design team.The system had to be designed to automotive industry standards and comply to all regulations for certification. Below are a list of areas I worked on to develop the system and key competencies.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Networks such as CAN, LIN, Bluetooth and WiFi</li>
                <li>Cybersecurity requirements such as authorisaton and authentication</li>
                <li>Supplier management</li>
                <li>Cross functional working</li>
                <li>UI design reviews</li>
                <li>Electro-mechanical design</li>
                <li>High gloss paint processes</li>

                <li>Radio frequency certification</li>
                <li>Display technology stacks</li>

            <h3>Bentayga facelift</h3>
            <p>For the Bentayga facelift project the objective was always to carryover the hardware used in the new Flying Spur. I was proactive in the design at the beginning of the project, so to save budget, I worked with my supplier to design a faceplate interface that would allow us to use the same parts, but in a different package. There was a reskin of the UI, so design reviews needed to take place once more. There was also the addition of extra radio features to control. There were other design changes to electrical architecture and messaging that also needed to be considered.  </p>

                <h3>Bentayga EWB</h3>
                <p>The Bentayga EWB as just recently been revealed to the public. It is a car that is focussed highly on the rear passenger, there were many new feature implementations to be made for this car. This car comes with a “wellness” pack that is only available to the rear occupant, and the TSR is the only way to control these features. The hardware was once again carried over from the previous project. The main portion of this work was working with the UX/UI team to develop a GUI for the new features and also working with relevant feature owners to get their features in the device.
